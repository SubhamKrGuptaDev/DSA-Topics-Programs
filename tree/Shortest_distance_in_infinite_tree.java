/**
 *
 * Consider you have an infinitely long binary tree having the pattern as below
 *                1
 *
 *             /     \
 *            2      3
 *
 *          /  \     /   \
 *         4    5   6     7
 *     .  .  .  .   .  .  .  .
 * Given two nodes with values x and y, the task is to find the length of the shortest path between the two nodes.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * X = 1
 * Y = 3
 * Output:
 * 1
 * Explanation:
 * 3 is the child of 1 so,
 * distance between them is 1.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * X = 2
 * Y = 2
 * Output:
 * 0
 * Explanation:
 * There is no node between 2 and 2.
 * Your Task:
 * You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function distance() which take integers X and Y as input parameters and returns the distance between X and Y in the infinitely long tree.
 *
 *
 * Expected Time Complexity: O(log (y - x))
 * Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=X,Y<=10^7
 *
