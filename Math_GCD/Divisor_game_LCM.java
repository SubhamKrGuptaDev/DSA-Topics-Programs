/**
 *
 * Problem Description
 * Scooby has 3 three integers A, B, and C.
 *
 * Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C.
 * You need to tell the number of special integers less than or equal to A.
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= A, B, C <= 10^9
 *
 *
 * * Example Input *
 * Input 1:
 *
 *  A = 12
 *  B = 3
 *  C = 2
 * Input 2:
 *
 *  A = 6
 *  B = 1
 *  C = 4
 *
 *
 * * Example Output *
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  2
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  1
 *
 *
 * * Example Explanation *
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  The two integers divisible by 2 and 3 and less than or equal to 12 are 6,12.
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *  Only 4 is a positive integer less than equal to 6 which is divisible by 1 and 4.
 *
 *  <>
 *      * Hint *
 *      We canâ€™t use loop, so we can try for another approach, i.e., find the
 *      lcm(the least common multiple) of B and C and find the number of
 *      elements less than equal to A, which is divisible by lcm.
 *      lcm(A,B)=(A*B)/(gcd(A,B))
 *  </>
